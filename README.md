# LD49
this project is a submission to the Ludum Dare 49 Compo, that or a complete failure.

## IDEAS
### Theme: unstable
##### definition
Tending strongly to change

Not constant; fluctuating

- tile-based 2d game, cracking/shaking tiles, that get destroyed
- falling left/right, have to actively balance (or anything that you need to actively rebalance)
- building something that you have to maintain
- reaction based game + decision between maintaining and expanding?
- tricky towers?

## final? idea:
tile-based 2d game, rougly linear straight line forward
procedurally generated enemies
continuous movement
turret rooted enemies that shoot bullet-hell projectiles at the player
dash
not instant death? 

## TODO

- [ ] render/store tiles in a queue
- [ ] move player
- [ ] start destroying tiles
